# Installation

## Stable release

To install github_commit_status, run this command in your terminal:

``` console
$ pip install github_commit_status
```

This is the preferred method to install github_commit_status, as it will
always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python
installation
guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.
